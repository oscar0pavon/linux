/*
 * fbdev-multi: one independent fb_info per driven CRTC, instead of one
 * fb_info spanning the bounding box of every connector (what the stock
 * "fbdev" client's drm_fb_helper_single_fb_probe() builds). That single
 * shared canvas is why fbcon cannot rotate one output independently of
 * another (see the sw_rotations fallback in drm_setup_crtcs_fb()) and why
 * con2fbmap(8) cannot bind different VTs to genuinely different buffers.
 *
 * Resource solving (which CRTC drives which connector) still has to happen
 * exactly once for the whole device: drm_client_modeset_commit() commits
 * every CRTC in a client's array atomically, so two independently-committing
 * clients would each blank the CRTCs the other one owns. That solve is
 * therefore owned by one "primary" drm_fb_helper/drm_client_dev, same as
 * the stock client. Every other driven CRTC gets its own "sibling"
 * drm_fb_helper/drm_client_dev, which never calls drm_client_modeset_probe()
 * or drm_client_modeset_commit() on its own client -- it only borrows a
 * stable pointer into the primary's already-solved client->modesets[]
 * array to learn its target mode and to publish its own fb into it before
 * the primary commits.
 *
 * Because the commit is all-or-nothing, the primary's modesets[] array has
 * to be fully consistent before anything commits it:
 *
 * - Every driven entry needs a struct drm_mode_set.fb. An entry that has a
 *   mode and connectors but no fb fails the "CRTC set but no FB" test in
 *   drm_atomic_plane_check() and takes the whole device down with it, not
 *   just its own CRTC. drm_client_modeset_probe() clears .fb on every
 *   entry (see drm_client_modeset_release()), so the fbs have to be
 *   republished after every probe, and a driven CRTC that no helper owns
 *   has to be released rather than left half-solved.
 * - Every driven entry needs .x/.y of zero. drm_client_modeset_probe()
 *   lays the outputs out inside the one bounding-box buffer the stock
 *   client allocates; those offsets become the plane's source coordinates
 *   in __drm_atomic_helper_set_config(), and a nonzero one runs off the
 *   end of a buffer that is only as large as its own CRTC.
 *
 * That is what drm_fbdev_multi_publish_fbs() maintains, and why no fb_info
 * is registered with the fbdev core before the first publish has run: the
 * primary's register_framebuffer() hands the device to fbcon, which
 * immediately calls fb_set_par and commits.
 *
 * struct drm_fb_helper's exported contract (->fb, ->info, ->buffer,
 * ->fbdefio are singular, and info->par resolves fbops callbacks straight
 * back to exactly one fb_helper) is relied on by every other fbdev_probe
 * driver (i915, msm, radeon, ...), so it is not touched here. Each CRTC
 * gets a genuinely separate struct drm_fb_helper instead.
 *
 * v1 scope: siblings are provisioned once, at setup, for connectors that
 * already have a solved mode (i.e. connected). A monitor plugged into a
 * connector that had no mode at setup time will not get its own fb device
 * until the next probe (module reload/reboot) -- creating a new client at
 * runtime is not possible from within a client's own ->hotplug callback,
 * since drm_client_register() holds dev->clientlist_mutex across the
 * synchronous initial ->hotplug() call, and the same mutex is held across
 * the whole iteration by the runtime hotplug/suspend/resume dispatchers in
 * drm_client_event.c. Such a CRTC is left disabled by
 * drm_fbdev_multi_publish_fbs() rather than being allowed to break the
 * commit for the outputs that do have an fb device.
 *
 * A sibling also keeps the struct drm_mode_set it was given at setup for
 * its whole life. If drm_client_modeset_probe() ever remaps which
 * connector drives which CRTC, a sibling's fb stays installed in an entry
 * that now describes a different output; when the new mode no longer fits
 * that fb the entry is released and the CRTC goes dark instead.
